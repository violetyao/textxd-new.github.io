TextXD aims to:

Foster a cross-disciplinary community of text processing experts from academia, research, and industry.

Develop a shared understanding of each otherâ€™s use of text processing data, algorithms, and software.

Help us learn from one another, through tutorials, and collaborative work sessions, about available tools and methods, and the applicability of these to various discipline-specific problems.
